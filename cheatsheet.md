**General Abilities**

*Cunning** **Assault[1 for N]*

For each N assault successes assigned to one vehicle (model with type vehicle) in assault, add one +1 to future damage token. If you manage to inflict two or more +1 to future damage tokens this way, the enemy is shaken.


**Orks Abilities**

*Reroll* *Assault[N]*
Each natural 6 rolled in assault count as 2 hits. Further, any natural 6 rolled in assault lets you reroll N dice per wave of rerolls, up to the maximum equal to the number of dice you have left. If any of the rerolled dice results in a natural 6, reroll again with a new wave of rerolls. You may reroll both assault and assault deflection dice, but only assault dice give further rerolls.

**Dwarfs**

*Endurence tokens*\
Endurence tokens may be spent in the following way: 

- Spend one endurence token to replace 'kill 1 model' with 'bleed[4]'. (note that you may spend another token if the result of the bleed damage is 'kill 1 model'. Do not roll for this bleed token during this agony phase). 
- After losing an assault, you may spend one endurence token AND take a d6 psychic damage. If you are not shaken afterward infantry base gains Stubborn.
- If you also have the trenchcoat of resistance equipment you may spend one token to reroll any result of poison damage


*Crippled Crew*

Unit gets -1 on all die roll for its range to-hit, assault strength and assault deflection. In addition, if unit is also shaken, any source of psychic damage now rolls on crew damage even though the unit is normally immune to psychic damage.
