**Reroll** **Assault[N]**
Each natural 6 rolled in assault count as 2 hits. Further, any natural 6 rolled in assault lets you reroll N dice per wave of rerolls. Thus N may never be greater than the number of dice you have left. If any of the rerolled dice results in a natural 6, reroll again with a new wave of rerolls.


*Dwarfs*

**Endurence tokens**
Endurence tokens may be spend in the following way:", 

- Spend one endurence token to replace 'kill 1 model' with 'bleed[4]'. (note that you may spend another token if the result of the bleed damage is 'kill 1 model'. Note that the original bleed[4] is removed when you get the 'kill 1 model', and it is then replaced with a fresh bleed from you other use of the endurence token). 
- After loosing an assault, you may spend one endurence token AND take a d6 psycic damage. If you are not shaken afterward infantry base gains Stuborn.
- If you also have the trenchcoat of resistance equipment you may spend one token to reroll any result of poison damage
