While hidden you cannot be fired upon or be assaulted, nor can you fire or assault. You are also immune to Fear and Terror\\ 
While hidden replace the unit base with a hidden token. If you have multiple hidden units you do not have to reveal which one is under which token (but you have to keep track your self). In the start of the game you do not have to show the enemy exactly what units you have hidden. (but you have to state how many victory points worth of units that are hidden)\\ 
You stay hidden until you reveal your self, have a speed slow in a clear hex with line of sight to an enemy, in aftermath phase if an enemy is within point blank range, or an enemy special action reveals your location\\ 
If you reveal your self you get reveal bonuses: +2 to hit, +1 to damage of ranged weapons and pluss 50 percent assault strength and deflection.\\ 
Hide action: remove your unit from the board, replace it with a hidden token. Only works in swamp terrain\\ 
Reveal: Place your infantry within 2 hexes of the hidden token and gain reveal bonuses\\ 
In addition to revealing your self as a movement order, you may reveal your self any time you share an hex with an enemy. If so, make an assault and gain the stated reveal bonuses\\
