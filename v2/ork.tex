Unit base gets the option to fire ONE of this weapon instead of regular weapons.\\ 
If one unit-base of size large or smaller is hit by this weapon but not killed, move the target one hex towards you in agony 0 phase. Keep orientation of the unit. If there are multiple hexes which you can move the target to, you may choose where to move the enemy. However you cannot move the unit into an impassable hex, or overcrowded hex if possible. If this is not possible, the unit is shaken instead of moved. If the unit is flying, move the target to the ground instead. If this movement forces the target to move into a hex occupied by you, carry out an assault.\\

Unit base gets the option to fire ONE of this weapon instead of regular weapons.\\ 
If one unit-base of size large or smaller is hit by this weapon but not killed, move the target one hex towards you in agony 0 phase. Keep orientation of the unit. If there are multiple hexes which you can move the target to, you may choose where to move the enemy. However you cannot move the unit into an impassable hex, or overcrowded hex if possible. If this is not possible, the unit is shaken instead of moved. If the unit is flying, move the target to the ground instead. If this movement forces the target to move into a hex occupied by you, carry out an assault.\\
