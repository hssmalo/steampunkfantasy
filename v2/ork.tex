If one unit of size large or smaller is hit by this weapon but not killed, ignore the first step of the units next movement order (movement phase 1) and replace it with a special movement instead. Carry out the second and third part of the movement order as normal. Move the target one hex towards you while keeping the orientation of the unit. If there are multiple hexes which you can move the target to, you may choose where to move the enemy. However you cannot choose to move the unit into an impassable hex, or overcrowded hex. If this is not possible, the unit is shaken instead of moved. If this movement forces the target to move into a hex occupied by you, carry out an assault.\\

Not Yet dead: after this model in the unit base is killed, this model is not yet dead after all. This model becomes a new unit base and becomes an Champion with the same equipment as this model and orders available as the unit base this model is attached to . Champion does not retain any of the abilities from the unit base or the model, and has a seperate model and unit base entry. See Champion. In the case this model is not the last model to be eliminated, it may be the case that you get an extra unit base in the hex.

Range: 5  Angle: [True, False, False, False]: AP: 2: Damage:d6-2 \\
Unit base gets the option to fire ONE of this weapon instead of regular weapons.\\ 
If one unit of size large or smaller is hit by this weapon but not killed, ignore the first step of the units next movement order (movement phase 1) and replace it with a special movement instead. Carry out the second and third part of the movement order as normal. Move the target one hex towards you while keeping the orientation of the unit. If there are multiple hexes which you can move the target to, you may choose where to move the enemy. However you cannot choose to move the unit into an impassable hex, or overcrowded hex. If this is not possible, the unit is shaken instead of moved. If this movement forces the target to move into a hex occupied by you, carry out an assault.\\
