Use once per game, use an throw fire order to place 2 smoke tokens and 2 poison cloud[6] tokens in either an adjecent hex or the hex you are standing in. Note that this does not make you immune to the effect of your own grenade.\\ 
If you also have the hidden ability, you may use the hide order regardless of terrain if you are either standing in a hex with smoke, or you are outside line of sight of any enemy unit. \\
