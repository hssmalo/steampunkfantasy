Carry out the second and third part of the movement order as normal. Move the target one hex towards you while keeping the orientation of the unit. If there are multiple hexes which you can move the target to, you may choose where to move the enemy. However you cannot choose to move the unit into an impassable hex, or overcrowded hex. If this is not possible, the unit is shaken instead of moved. If this movement forces the target to move into a hex occupied by you, carry out an assault.\\
