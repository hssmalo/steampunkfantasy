\noindent When fired at, you may pretend to look at normal infantry damage table unless the damage is 4 or above, for which the illusion is given away and is removed from play.\\ 
Further, if the illusion is matched with one real infantry base, it may mimic the orders of that infantry, and may follow it whereever the infantry goes.\\ 
The illusion have the exact same modifiers and abilities with regard to being hit as the infantry it is mimicing. Thus, the illusion has Take Cover[still][-2], Take Cover[still][-3], and camufloulage[forrest][-1] as appropritate \\ 
 Thus the enemy do not know which are illusions and which are real. However if, for any reason, the enemy gets information which gives the illusion away, the illusion is not removed from play, but must be identified by an illusion marker. For example if the illusion was fired at by something which does psychic damage, it would require you to tell the enemy that this unit does not have a psychic damage table, which would give the illusion away.\\ 
If the illusion is not in a hex with a friendly infantry, it has only chase order available\\
