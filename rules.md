## Build your army.


- A pure tank game consists of 24 industry points(ip)
- An infantry battle consists of 24manpower (mp), 24crafts points and 24xp.
- A standar game consists of 24industry points(ip), 24manpower (mp), 24crafts points (cp) and 24xp.
- An asymetric game consists of one side having 36ip and a combination of 12 points in mp, xp and cp, while the other team chooses between
48mp, 48cp, 48xp and 36mp, 36cp, 36xp, 12ip.


Industry represent heavy equipment production such as tanks and vehicles.
Manpower: Represent the manpower needed to form infantry and cavalry.
Craft points represent small arms production, and everything which is hand crafted by a smith or that alike. XP represent extra training, and taming of fantastical creatures (Command: gives you officers, officers abilities and engineering etc. Advanced games only. Not yet implemented.)

Build your army in any way you like, as long as the total cost is less than the total amount of points.
Infantry, and some cavalry and special units may be upgraded with xp and crafts points (and command).
Each upgrade has it requirements. Some upgrade the entire unit, while some only upgrade one model.


A unit typically has 1,2 or 4 unit models. A unit can be upgraded with as much as you like as long as you have the space on your model.
Unless otherwise stated, an infantry unit may have

- 1 twohanded weapon or 2 onehanded equipment (such as heavy musket, pistol&shield ...)
- Any number of independent equipment (such as grenades, gas-masks, wings...)
- A unit may have a maximum of one shared weapon. (hand-held cannon)

Unless otherwise stated, the standard weapons of an infantry is a 2handed weapon


Each model of the unit can fire it's weapons independently, and you add assault dice to the assault die pool for each unit. But all models of a unit gets the same order, and share the same damage table.

Elites typically upgrades 1 regular model, which then replaces the regular model in the units.
Weapons upgrades and aditions either replaces all weapons in all models in a unit, replaces the weapon of a single model (typical elite), or the weapon is shared by the entire unit not replacing the normal weapon. However normaly you then must choose between firng a unit weapon or the normal weapon of the model. 

In some cases some equipment reqiuers an elite and the cost is typically for one weapon and only one elite in the unit gets that weapon. However, as long as you have more elites left in the unit, you may pay the price multiple times to equip as many as you like with elite weapons.

Shared weapons:
Unless otherwise stated, if a unit is given a shared weapon, the unit may fire the shared weapon a single time, OR fire its normal weapon. When firing the shared weapon, apply to-hit modifiers of the best model in the unit. Regardless which weapon you fired, threat any weapon as unloaded after firing with either a shared weapon or the standar weapons of the models in the unit.

The requirements and cost of both model replacements and extra equipment should be clearly stated in the army list.


*Huge* units\

Any huge unit is seen from long distance. Thus, if your army includes any huge unit, you must tell your enemy about which huge unit you include before the enemy builds its own army. Thus the enemy has some time to prepare.

# Terrain 

This game is played on a hex-based map. Each hex contains a given type of terrain, some blocks line of sight and hinders movement and gives cover. For the last, see to-hit table under the fire section.

It is also possible that smoke, entrenchements etc. modify the default terrain.

For movement and line of sight, se table below:
--------              -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clear                 No modifiers
Mountains             tracked and wheeled: cannot enter
Hills                 Level 1 blocking terrain 
Forest                walks: enter freely, tracked and wheeled: enter at 2+
                      Level 0 blocking terrain
Burned Forrest        Level 0 blocking terrain
Ruins	              Does not block line of sight
Rough                 Does not block line of sight
Sand Dunes            ELevel 0 blocking terrain
*Advanced* *terrain*
Swamp                 medium and smaller enter and exit freely.
                      large and huge: enter at 2+
                      Units with track or wheel in description may get stuck,
                      exit: 3+
                      Does not block line of sight
Building              Infantry enter freely
                      any other type cannot enter without a special rule. Level 0 blocking terrain.
Road                  If moving from a road to another hex with road, movement is always freely.
Smoke                 Blocks line of sight 
                      Removed in aftermath. (place two smoke markers, remove 1 in each aftermath)
River                 ???		      
Water                 1 movement point to enter for ships, floating or flying
                      (and can only be entered while flying). Cannot be entered by any other way.
--------              -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Line of sight from one hex to another: place a line from the center of the heighest level to the center of the lowest level hex in question. If the line crosses a hex with blocking terrain equal or greater height both hexes in question, line of sight is blocked. This is the normal case when everything is on the ground. In the case of line of sight to heigher elevation some special rules apply. If the line crosses paths with blocking terrain less than both hexes in question, ignore the blocking terrain (flying units can thus fire at all flying units). If the line is traced through a hex with blocking terrain heigher or equal to the end hex, but not the start hex, place a blind hex directly behind the hex with blocking terrain. Line of sight cannot be traced to or from the blind hex, but can be traced to hexes behind that. (flying units has a line of sight advantage)


*Flying* Count as being at height level 2.

Terrain also provide cover, which is given in the to-hit table later.

*Stacking* *Limit*:\
One hex may maximum hold either up two 2 units if at most one of them is large, or 1 huge unit.
Flying units have the same stacking limits, but while flying is independent of stacking limit on ground. A flying unit may even share a hex with an enemy.

If trying to enter the same hex with MORE than that simultaneously, all from within same team/faction, then all units trying to move into the hex stay put.
If done on purpose by the commander, they are also *shaken* (se unit abilities and conditions) next turn. 

\pagebreak

# Building battle ground.

## Scenario: ENTRENCHED!

For a standar game: \
7x9 hexes.

The battlefield is diveded into three parts: \
NoMansLand: 2.5 and 3 middle hex rows\
Side 1: 2,5 and 3 hexes closest to side 1 of the board.\
Side 2: 2,5 and 3 hexes closest to side 2 of the board.\

NoMansLand cannot contain any blocking or advanced terrain.
Each side may design it's own terretory as you wish.

# Setup

Blind Setup:
Place a GM Screen (or something) between each side. Set up your units without know how the other side has set up. Set up simultainiusly.
Place units in the hexes 2.5 and 3 hexes from the edge of your side. Remeber to give them the appropriate starting speed as you see fit.

# Victory Condition

Choose which style to play:

1. Friendly match

All enemies are eliminated!


2. Tournament style: FIXED TIME

After a fixed amount of time, finish your last turn. However, do a special end-phase: Repeat agony phase 0 to agony phase 4 for all units until either a unit does not have any continues damage are gone OR the unit is killed. Units with healing or repair abilities may apply these in these end-phases.
In addition, move shaken units a number of turns until they are not shaken any more. 

After a fixed amount of time, each player scores points according to the following:

6pt for each destroyed enemy IP \
2pt for each destroyed enemy MP, XP and CP \
3pt for each crippled enemy IP \
1pt for each crippled enemy MP, XP and CP \
3pt for each remaning IP from your own team. \
1pt for each remaning MP, XP and CP from your own team. \
+16pt bonus if you won the match (ie, score more points than your enemy from the above points) \

Only totally destroyed units counts as destroyed. A unit is crippled when: the game ends and it is shaken, has lost atleast half of the starting number of models, has any critticle damage token or crippled crew effect, have a number of +1 to future damage token equal to half (rounded down) required to kill the entire unit or the units flees the battlefield. Note that you get points for crippling your enemy but lose none for your own crippled units. 

Thus normally:
An infantry unit with 2 out of 4 models standing counts as crippled. For tanks you normally need about 9 to kill the unit, thus a tank with +4 to future damage counts as crippled. 

Both the winner and the loser record points.
This is now called Match Victory Points (MVP).

The tournament victory points (TVP) are calculated as follows:

$$TVP = (| MVP | )^{0.5} $$ 

Note that both players get more points by destroying each other. Thus it is possible that a loser of one match scores more points than a winner of another match. This rewards playing aggressive.

\pagebreak



# Orders

Give each unit at least one movement order and the number of fire orders dictated by the unit stats. At any time you should have orders 1 round of orders ahead of time. For most units, this means you should have 1 movement order and one fire order on the table when making a new order. Then, after setting up orders, you should follow those orders.


Action are ordered in advance, and in principal everything in one step is done simultaneously. However, if the orders include choices as for example who to fire at etc. and that choice depends on what the enemy choice is, then resolve it as follows: Any unit which MAY enter an assault depending on the choices it does in movement (if existing), declares whether it want to enter an assault or not. The ones not entering assaults must choose first, and the ones entering assault second, and they must then enter assault (if possible). If there are still choices which depends on what the other chooses, the ones choosing last according to this table. The highest rank choices last:

Spartan \
Elf \
Dark Elf \
Dwarf \
Gnome \
Ork \


Movement orders are dependent on whether you are fast, slow or stand-still (or possible other as special rules).

Movement orders may for example be:
(fast) F, F, -\
(fast) F, L, -\
(fast) F, B, - -\
(slow) A, F,  -\
(still) -, -, - \

Each unit has a set of available orders. Code:


- F = forward
- R = rotate one click right
- L = rotate one click left
- B = brake, change to one speed slower.
- B[X] = as brake, but set speed to a special case, described by a X.
- A = Accelerate, change to one speed faster
- A[X] = As accelerate, but set speed to a special case, described by a X.
- Rev=reverse
- D=Drift: Move 1 hex in any direction, regardless of facing. But do not rotate the unit.
- - = no action
- Chase: move towards nearest enemy, taking current orders into account. Thus the unit moves one step closer to where the enemy is going to be this turn.
- Follow: Are only available through special unit ordering other units to follow, and all units under these orders move one hex closer to this unit. If multiple units are odering units to follow, you can chose which to follow.
- 360$^0$: rotate in any direction you want.
- Flee: Move in any hex you like as long as you move further away from the enemy. If no such hex is available, move to a hex which is not closer to the enemy
If still no such hex is available, let your enemy move your unit to any hex he/she likes
- Road: Move along the road. Facing is always along the road.
- Help: Move in any hex as long as you move 1 step closer to an injured ally which you can heal/repair. As with chase, take current orders into account.


Any order divided in 3 happens in movement step, where the first is executed in movement 1, the second in movement 2 and the third in movement 3.
If Two different letters are separated by + instead of a comma, they happen in same step. For example: \
-360$^0$+A, F, F \

Would read you could rotate 360$^0$ and accelerate in first movement, and forward in movement 2 and 3.


Gunnery orders are for example:\
-, Aim \
-, Load (still) \
-, Fire\
Aim, -\
Load, -\
Fire, -\
Spot, spot \


Default Gunnery: -, - \

The first is executed in gunnery 1, the second in gunnery 2. 
Some orders are only available during one or more specific speeds/movement modes.
If a movement triggers a change in speed, it is possible that the first gunnery order (part 1) is not allowed, but part 2 is. If a unit brakes and goes from fast to slow, gunnery part 1 does not allow gunnery orders associated with slow but gunnery part 2 do.

If an illegal order is given, do the default order instead.


Load: loads weapon. A weapon cannot fire without a load token available.
      Some weapons may load more than one ammo per loading. It is then noted as load[2] or load[5] \
Aim : optional: +2 to hit. Last 1 round, and may only be used versus targets within line of sight from the original hex where the aim was issued\
Fire: fire at an enemy within line of sight and within a legal firing angle of a unit. \
Spot: try to reveal a hidden unit. Roll a normal to-hit as if you where shooting. If successfull the hidden unit is revealed. \
Default: - \


The speed of the unit may restrict what options are available, which is given in paranthesis. For example \
(still) load, - 
means this unit only can load while standing still.

If, for some reason or another, the given order for one step is not allowed, it does nothing.

Important, unless otherwise stated, a unit MUST not fire at any target if it does not wish to even if you give it fire orders. This may be the case if you want to save the ammo for a better shot later.

\pagebreak

# Angles
All units are always facing one specific direction, noted as forward. Then all units has a front, front-side (Right), frond-side (left), back-side (Right), back-side(left) and and back angle.

Some values and stats depend on the angle you are using. All stats dependent on angles is divided into 4, noted as [4,3,2,1].
The first entry is front, the second is front-side (both left and right), the third entry is back-side(both left and right) and fourth is back.

*Firing* *angles*:
\* indicates firing angle is allowed, - indicates firing with that weapon is not allowed in that angle. Anything going to the front hex-side is considered in front, and anything tracing line of sight through side-front hex-side is considered front-side etc. Shots directly inbetween front and front-side are considered on-edge of firing angle, and can be used but at a penalty (see to-hit table).

[true, false, false, false] Can fire in front only \
[true, true, true, true]   Can fire in any direction \


*Armor*:
Use the armor value which your target is using.
[4,3,3,2]   has 4 armor in front, 3 in front-side, 3 in back-side and 2 in back.

Any shot where line of sight can be traced through the front of the target is considered hitting the target in front and so forth. If a shot can be traced on the exact border between two angles, the attacker may choose where to apply the hit.

Any stat which is not divided in 4 groups is assumed to be identical for all angles.

*Fixed* *Weapons*

Some models, instead of having onr raotating gun have multiple guns pointing at different dirrections. In this case, each gun is treated as only being able to fire  in the given direction, but when the weapon system is fired, all are fired simultainiously at different direction. In this case a number indicated the number of shots/weapons being able to fire in the given dirrection.

For example \
[x2,x1,x1/-]
indicates that the unit may fire 2 times in front, one in front-side left, once in front-side right, once in back side right and once in back side left.


ps! All units are symmetrical with respect to left and right!

\pagebreak

# Fire

At firing orders, you may roll a die to see if you hit any enemy whish you can trace line of sight to. 

Basic to-hit: 5+

Roll an open ended d6 for to-hit.

-If you roll a N to hit, you may roll another d6. If you roll above 4, add one to the original result. Keep rolling dice as long as you roll above 4.

Example: open ended d6: You roll a 6, then a 5 and you may roll another die. That ends up a 6 again. You roll another die and you roll a 3. The result is 6+1+1=8.


On-edge hexes: \
The firing vehicles decides which hex side the shots come from and enter into.
However, employing hexes at the edge of it's own firing angle gives a to-hit penalty.


*Area* *To-Hit*: \
Area(n+): roll 1 die per enemy model in hex. Apply damage per success.

\pagebreak

# Damage

If you hit, roll for damage. Apply the following modifiers to Armor Penetration (AP) and damage:

                          AP                    Damage    special
------------------------ -------------------- ---------- ---------------------

Point Blank               +1                    +1        (Range=1)
------------------------ -------------------- ---------- ---------------------




Unless the damage is of a specific type, any specified damage is regular damage, and follow these rules:

## Armor

Before you roll damage, roll armor penetration first. If unit does not have armor, skip this step, and threat shot as penetrated all armor.


Roll (Armor - AP) number of dice, minimum 0, where Armor is the armor of the target unit from the side you hare firing from, and AP is the armor penetration of the weapon.\



                          Number of armor dice     Success
------------------------ ----------------------- -----------    
$AP \geq 0$                 A-AP                     5+


For

- 2 or more dice equal or above 5, the armor prevents all damage 
- Exactly one dice equal or above 5, roll on damage with a -3 modifier 
- 0 die above 5, roll on damage normaly. 



Roll the amount of damage indicated by the weapon, modified with the folling

                        damage modifier
----------------------- ----------------
*armor*
Blocked by armor          $-\infty$
Partly blocked by armor  -3
Penetrated armor          0 (some weapons grants you +3 here)
*previous results* 
Previous damage          +1 per token
*range*
Long range               -1
Normal range              0
Point Blank              +1
*Unit* *resistances*
XXX Resistance N         -N if damage type matches resistance.
                            (damage type is regular if unspecified)



## Damage Table:

Compare the result with the regular damage table of the unit.
Any result less than the starting value of the damage table counts as no damage. 
Else, read of the result and apply the damage from the damage table.


Whenever a model in one unit dies, half previous bonus to damage round down.
If a model dies from poison, remove the poison afterwards
If a model dies from bleeding, remove the bleeding.

\pagebreak

# Assault

If two or more units from different team/faction tries to enter the same hex simultaneously, use ASSAULT rules.
Assaults also is conducted if two or more units from different teams try to enter each others hex. Ie they are facing each other and both moving forward.

- Before any assault, any unit which has the ability to retreat before assault have the option to do so now. This includes ALL other pre-assault retreat abilities, such as Fear.

In the case where units facing each other are all moving forward, there might be two or more equally valid ways to conduct the assault. In this case, the team with the heighest melee skills determine which hex (or hexes) are being faught over:

Spartan\
Dark Elf\
Ork\
Dwarf\
Elf\
Gnome \

The one gaining the advantage of the assault enters the hex it tried to enter, and disadvantage is forced out of the hex, it then retreats. If one with disadvantage was stationary, it moves out of the hex in the backward direction. If the disadvantage was trying to enter a hex, it stays in the hex it was before trying to enter the hex. 

If trying to retreat into a overcrowded hex, or an enemy, or an impassable hex, retreat to the closest possible hex, with the one controling the unit deciding where. If, in the rare case you are completely surronded by  enemies, conduct another assault into the hex you normaly would have reatreated to. If you tried to enter a hex, and failed to do so, but the hex you where before is occupied by the enemy, or becomes overcrowed by your own units, treat it as retreating to an impassable hex: thus move to the closest possible hex. If you are at the edge of the battlefield, the unit gains stuborn trait. Which means that the unit is never forced to retreat from a hex it previously occupied, and it is the other unit which retreats instead. 

If more than Stacking Limit number of units enters the hex after winning an assault, all winners are also shakened as if trying to move into a hex with friendly units only. Also, note that a maxium of 2 units may contribute it's firepower.

In any way, during a retreat, the loser may rotate to Left or Right or 180$^0$ if you wish as part of the retreat. This is to make retreated unit able to flee the assault if it wants to.


Assault: Each model have the followint stats for hitting the enemy in assault:\
Number of dice, to_hit, any Damage modifiers. \
Facing : Use front assault values and armor for units entering the hex, with the exception, when reversing into an assault, set facing = back.
         For stationary units being assaulted, use assault and armor from the side which it is assaulted from.
	 If being assaulted from more than one side, choose one. This unit may only deflect hits from this side.
	 


Multiple Units: add all dice for up to stacking_limit number of units, roll separate dice if necessary, both if the different units have different to_hit value for the assault and if they have different damage output.
It may be the case that some units involved have better damage, it is then necessary to track which unit did hit and which did not. If you for example have an orc-warhero with a flaming waraxe in a mix with 3 ork-grunts, roll all dice for the warhero with red dice and the grunts with blue die. If a red die hits, you may employ the flaming waraxe special damage, but if only blue dice hit, you may not.

Simillarly as for assault, some models may have assault deflection and is given in the stats of a model by
Assault Deflection: Number of dice, to_hit\
Apply front/front-side/back-side/back values as appropriate similar to the assaults.
Add the number of dice for all unit involved in the assault, roll separate dice if they have different to_hit stats.
Each succuessfull deflection remove one successful assault from the enemy. However, the one with advantage in the assault chooses which hits to deflect.

A good practice is to roll assault and assault deflections simultanieously but with different color. Choose for example green die for deflections.


Whoever rolls the highest number of successfull assaults (after deflection) gains the advantage. If equal, use Nation assault winning-power order.

Spartan\
Dark_Elf\
Ork\
Dwarf\
Gnome\
Elf\



It is the one who have the advantage of the assault which are preveliged to choose which enemy hits he deflects, and which of his own successes are deflected.

Now, both sides, both the disadvantage and the advantage applies assault success to the enemy. Assault successes are either damage or support.
You start of by distributing the damaging hits, up to a maxium one damaging hit to a unit per alive model. Further hits are applied as support to any one ore more damage roll. Keep track of which hit are from which source. Support gives you +1 damage to the result per support given, and only damage rolls potentially causes cassualties.


Thus, if you have ONE attack which is far stronger than other attacks, it's wise to gain the advantage so that you make sure that that attack does not get deflected.

For each damage hit, apply damage similar to ranged combat. Apply assault damage, roll for assault AP versus armor, add any special effect and roll on the damage table of the unit.

Example: \

DarkElf: Tank + a infantry base with 4 models: total 9 assault dice with success at 5+ and 11 deflection dice with success at 6+\
Elf: Tank + a infantry base with 3 alive modles: total 8 assault dice wth success at 5+, but no deflection.\

DarkElf rolled 5 success and 3 deflection \
Elf rolled 6 successes (3 from E34 and 3 from infantry)\
DarkElf scores 5 hits and elf score 6-3 = 3 hits. Advantage DarkElf \

Thus the DarkElf gained the advantage, and chooses to deflect the 3 attacks from the tank (they may or may not be nastier in the real game).
The elf choose to assign 3 damaging scores from his infantry to the enemy infantry, since he suspect that the DarkElfs armor is good enough to protect it. Might as well kill some infantry in the process.
The Darkelf choosed to assign 3 damaging scores to the infantry and 1 damaging + 2 support to the tank, in hope of doing some damage. Thus the attack on the tank gets +2 to damage.

Rolling for damage:\
Elf rolls 3 times on infantry damage table, but manage to kill only 2 models. \
Dakr Elf also rolled 3 times on infantry damage tabale, but managed to kill all 3 infantry. Then he roll for damage once versus the Elf's tanks, but the elf's armor proves to be difficult to penetrate. No damage done\

Then the Elf retreats from the hex, but atleast it's tanks is unharmed. \

If in the rare case that unit does not do real damage in assault, but does only psycic damage instead, and this unit is mixed with units that does real damage, threat real and psycic as seperate entries with respect to distributing damaging and supporting hits. Thus you may roll one real damage PER enemy model in unit in addition to one psycic damage PER enemy model in unit. Units with real damage support attacks from real damage, while support from unit with psycic damage support attacks with psycic damage. If a model does both regular and psycic damage, support gives +1 to regular damage and +1 to psycic damage.


Examples:
Standard Tank\
   Assault:     [4, 3, 3, 2]  Die 5+: Armor Penetration 3, damage d6-1.\
   Deflection:  [2, 0, 0, 0]  Die: 5+

This tank rolls 4 dice which hits on 5+ when assaulting a hex, and also when being assaulted from the front. Then it also gains 2 deflection die.
If this tank is stationary and is assaulted from the sides (front left, front right, back left, back right) it only gets 3 dice and no deflections, while if it assault from behind it only gets 2 dice..

# Special Damage types


Unless otherwise stated by the weapon, any weapon has regular damage. Some weapons and effects may have special damage in addition or instead of their normal damage. 

Generic damage types will be noted by the following in weapon stats:\
- [type] damage[dN]
For example, a weapon may have Psychic Damage in addition to regular damage.

If so, and if the target has a damage table of name equal to the type of damage, roll a dN on that damage table. For example if you have
- d6 psycic damage
Roll a d6 on psychic damage table of target.
If the target don't have a psychic damage table, the unit is immune to this damage.

Some special damage types are listed below:

**Direct** **Fire** **damage**:
 
- Does not ignore armor 
- Ignore regular damage resistances
- Reduce damage by fire resistances of target
- Apply bonus to damage based on the number +to future damage tokens
- Apply damage to the regular damage table.

Most fire damage comes from the 'set on fire' ability of weapons, which is a continius damage.



**Acid**: (roll by enemy)\ 

- At agony step 0, roll a die: \
			     at 1-: Downgrade from acid to minor acid.\
    	      	      	     at 2 : +1 to future damge\
			     at 3 : as 2, and place a poison cload [4] at hex.\
			          : and all units in this hex gets a minor acid token. \
                             at 4:  As 3, and if unit has armor, it is reduced by 1 (all directions) \
			     at 5 : As 4 and unit is set on fire.\
			     at 6 : Roll twice on this table., 

- If you happen to get two (or more) downgrade in same round, you remove acid instead of downgrading it.

- If not removed, roll again next turn.

**Minor** **Acid**:

- At agony step 1 roll a die, at 3+, unit gets +1 on future damage. At 2-, remove minor acid

**Contnius** **Fire** **Damage**

- At agony step 2, roll a d6. \
- At 1, the fire stops and do no damage. Remove the fire from the unit. \
- Otherwise, that unit take that much fire damage, ignoring ALL armor. 
- Reduce damage by fire resistances of target
- Apply bonus to damage based on the number +future damage tokens
- Apply damage to the regular damage table.

- Ignor regular damage resistances
- 
If a 1 was not rolled, the unit continues burning next round.


**Poisoned**[n]\
Only biological units affected (with BIO in type). All other types ignore poison.

- At agony step 3: Roll a dN (d4, d6, d8, d10 or d12) on regular damage.

- Ignore armor and regular damage resistances
- Reduce damage by poison resistances of target
- Apply bonus to damage based on the number +future damage tokens
- Apply damage to the regular damage table.

If poison DID not kill a model of the unit, downgrade poison by one step (12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> NONE)
However if it did, remove that instance of poison from unit. 


**Bleeding**:

- At agony step 4: Bleeding[n]: roll a dN.

- If you get 1, remove the bleeding with no effect.
- Ignore armor and regular damage resistances
- Apply bonus to damage based on the number +future damage tokens
- Apply damage to the regular damage table, with the exception that bleedid does not cause more bleeding.
- If bleeding kills one model, remove this bleeding effect.

# Unit Abilities and conditions:

**Evation**[-N]

Modified the success of an area of effect. For example, an Area(5+) effect will no be an Area(6+) effect if N=-1. Furhter, an Area(6+) will now be an Area(7+), where you use the open ended d6 rules to get 6.

**Take Cover**[speed, -N]

When unit is in given speed the unit is considered taking cover and gets -N to be hit, as indicated by to-hit table. Whenever this condition apply, the unit gains evation[-1], or evation[-2] in cover providing terrain. 

**Forward Position**[N]

At setup this unit may setup upt to N hexes away from normal setup area.

**Pre-Assault** **retreat**[N+]

In pre-assault phase you may roll a die. At N+ you may retreat before the assaults starts. Treat this as a regular reatreat but give or take no assault damage. If speed is currently at stand-still it become slow afterwards. This ability may only be used if the hex retreating into neither becomes overcrowded, is an illegal hex or contain enemies.

The unit have this ability if atleast one model in the unit has this spesicial ability.

**Stuborn**

After loosing an assualt, you never retreat, and the enemy retreats instead. If both units have stuborn, fight assault again.

**Terror**[range=n][dN]

In agony 0, roll a dN psycic damage on any enemy unit within range of this unit. Half number of dice rounded down from all enemy shaken units entering assault with you. Your enemy chooses which dice to remove if they represent different attacks

**Fear**[N]

In pre-assault phase, roll a dN on psychic damage for each enemy unit which has a psychic damage table (ignore armor and regular damage modifiers)
Half number of dice rounded down from all enemy shaken units entering assault with you. Your enemy chooses which dice to remove if they represent different attacks

\pagebreak

**Cunning** **Assault**[1 per N]

For each N assault successes assigned to one vehicle (model with type vehicle) in assault (assault damage and supporting hits), add +1 to all future damage token to that whith the vehicle type. If you manage to inflict two or more +1 to future damage this way, the enemy is shaken.

Thus, for example if you hit the an enemy with a unit which have Cunning Assault[1 per 2] 4 times, you will add two +1 to future damage tokens and the enemy is shaken. 


This represent any cunning way to take out heavily armored units in assaults, where regular hits would do little damage.

**Burst(N)**

This weapon can have, and must be loaded with N ammo to be fired. However, when the weapon is fired, it is fired N times (per model) at the same enemy unit.

**Limited Ammo(N)**

**Heal(N, unit, phase)**

N: a number \\
Unit: self or any unit in same hex \\
Phase: Either first or second healing phase\\

Healing only works on biological units. You have N points to spend on the following actions:

Phase: Either first or second healing phase\\

Repear do not work on biological units. You have N points to spend on the following actions:

- Remove one +1 to future damage token. Cost 1. 
- Neutrilize one minor acid. Cost 1 
- Remove 1 shaken token to any non-biological unit. Cost 1 
- Extinguish one fire. Cost 3. 
- Remove 1 crittical damage effect. Cost 3. 
- Degrade one acid to minor acid. Cost 4. 


**Set** **on** **Fire**, ranged weapons

If target is hit atleast once by a ranged weapon with this special ability, target is set on fire. See continous damage. If already on fire, apply another fire token.

**Set** *on* **Fire**, assault weapons

Any unit hit atleast once in assault by a unit with this special is set on fire. See continous damage.


**(minor) Acid**, ranged weapons

If target is hit by a ranged weapon with this special ability, apply (minor) acid to target. See continous damage. Apply one (minor) acid per hit.

**(minor)** **Acid[1 for N]**, assault weapons

Apply one minor Acid to an any enemy unit for each N successfull assault hits. If N=2 this means you may place one minor acid token for every 2nd successful assault die you do. For Minor acid, see continoius damage.

**Acid Resistance[N+]** In 1st healing phase, roll a die per acid token. Remove one minor acid token or reduce one acid to minor acid, per die above N.

**Poison[N]**, ranged weapons

If target is hit by a ranged weapon with this special ability, apply Poison[N] to taget unit. See continous damage. Apply one Poison[n] per hit.

\pagebreak

**Poison[M][1 for N]**, assault weapons

Apply one Poison[M] to an enemy unit for each N successful assault hits. If N=2 this means you may place one Poison[M] token per 2nd hit. For poison, see continous damage.




[type] **Resistances**[n]

Reduce damage by [n] from damage of given type.
Default type of any shot is regular damage. Other types are always specified.

Regular: any damage rolled on regular damage table of unspecified type. This does not include damage from any other type. \
Psychic : any damage rolled on psychic damage table.\
Poison : any damage rolled by poison effect\
Fire   : any fire damage rolled 

Any other resistance may be added in future. It then is effective only versus the spesific damage type.
Damage type is either regular damage, or explisitly given by the firing unit or effect.


**Shaken**:

*Shaken*: when first shaken, place two shaken tokens. If further shaken is placed on a unit which is allready shaken, place only one. One shaken token is removed during each aftermath. While shaken a unit carries out the default order for movement, and do no actions in fireing pahses. For vehicles and robots this represent temporarily mechanical problems.

Replace all movement orders with the default for the given speed (given in unit description), and no orders for gunnery action while shaken. 

**Misfire[N-]**

Before using any fire action, roll a die. At N- (N or below) replace the fire action with a do nothing action. (thus this action does not spend any ammo if it misfires)

**Jammed**

Cannot fire any weapon while jammed. Requirs an 'load' action to remove.


**Crippled Crew**

Unit gets -1 on all dice assosiated with range to-hit, assault strength and assault deflection dice. In addition, if unit is also shaken, any source of psycic damage now rolls on crew damage even though the unit is normaly immune to psycic damage. 


\pagebreak

**Hidden**

While hidden you cannot be fired upon or be assaulted, nor can you fire or assault. You are also immune to Fear and Terror,

While hidden replace the unit with a hidden token. If you have multiple hidden units you do not have to reveal which one is under which token (but you have to keep track your self). In the start of the game you do not have to show the enemy exactly what units you have hidden. (but you have to state how many victory points worth of units that are hidden),

You stay hidden until you reveal your self, in aftermath phase if an enemy is within point blank range, or an enemy special action reveals your location. Cloacking devices stay hidden even if in clear terrain, while all others sources of hidden abilities are revealed if they are in slow or fast in clear terrain within line of sight to an enemy.

If you reveal your self you get reveal bonuses: +2 to hit, +1 to damage of ranged weapons and pluss 50 percent assault strength and deflection.,

Reveal order: Place your unit within 2 hexes of the hidden token and gain reveal bonuses. In addition to revealing your self as a movement order, you may reveal your self any time you share an hex with an enemy. If so, make an assault and gain the stated reveal bonuses"

**Hide\[terrain\]**
If your unit have a hide action order available: remove your unit from the board, replace it with a hidden token. Only works in given terrain",

# Hex based effect.

Hex based effects are triggered in all 'trigger hex based effects' steps. 
When placing Clouds, smoke or fire on a hex for the first time, place two markers of the given type. Otherwise, place only one.
Hex based effects are not cumulative. However the effect of acid, fire and poison on units are cumulative with both itself and each other. 
In case of poison clouds with different strength, apply the strongest if overlapping.

Follow the instructions for each hex based effect

**Poison** **Cloud** [N] 


Area(6+): roll 1 die per model in hex. At 6+, apply a poison[N] to target, and do dN in crew damage.
Note that 

**Acid** **Cloud** [Minor] 

Area(6+) roll 1 die per model in hex. At 6+ place a minor acid on the unit.


**Acid** **Cloud** [Major] 

Roll a die per unit in hex. At 6+ place a regular acid on the unit.



**Poison** & **Acid** **Cloud** [N, minor/major] = poison Cloud[N] + acid Cloud [minor/major]



**Hex** **on** **Fire**\
When setting a hex on fire, place a smoke and fire token in the hex.
When encountering a fire, Roll 1 die per unit, at 6+ set that unit on fire.

**Smoke**
Blocks line of sight and gives to-hit penalties, which stacks with other terrain features.





**AFTERMATH**: \
Remove one Cloud or smoke in each hex

Remove one fire token in a hex and replace any forest in such a hex with rough terrain.

Remove one shaken token from each unit.




**Special Team abilities**

*Orks*

**Reroll** **Assault[N]**
Each natural 6 rolled in assault count as 2 hits. Further, any natural 6 rolled in assault lets you reroll N dice per wave of rerolls. Thus N may never be greater than the number of dice you have left. If any of the rerolled dice results in a natural 6, reroll again with a new wave of rerolls.


*Dwarfs*

**Endurence tokens**
Endurence tokens may be spend in the following way:", 

- Spend one endurence token to replace 'kill 1 model' with 'bleed[4]'. (note that you may spend another token if the result of the bleed damage is 'kill 1 model'. Note that the original bleed[4] is removed when you get the 'kill 1 model', and it is then replaced with a fresh bleed from you other use of the endurence token). 
- After loosing an assault, you may spend one endurence token AND take a d6 psycic damage. If you are not shaken afterward infantry base gains Stuborn.
- If you also have the trenchcoat of resistance equipment you may spend one token to reroll any result of poison damage
