## Build your army.


- A pure tank game consists of 24 industry points(ip)
- An infantry battle consists of 24manpower (mp), 24crafts points and 24xp.
- A standar game consists of 24industry points(ip), 24manpower (mp), 24crafts points (cp) and 24xp.
- An asymetric game consists of one side having 48ip and a combination of 6 points in mp, xp or cp, while the other team chooses between
48mp, 48cp and 48xp and 36mp, 36cp, 36xp and 12ip.
- In advanced games, add 24command (com) and 12mp for each side.


Industry represent heavy equipment production. Tanks and vehicles.
Manpower: Represent the manpower needed to form infantry and cavalry.
Craft points represent small arms production, and which is hand crafted.
XP represent extra training, and taming of fantastical creatures
(Command: gives you officers, officers abilities and engineering etc. Advanced games only. Not yet implemented.)

Build your army in any way you like, as long as the total cost is less than the total amount of points.
Infantry, and some cavalry and special units may be upgraded with xp and crafts points (and command).
Each upgrade has it requirements. Some upgrade the entire unit base, while some only upgrade one model.


A unit base typically has 1,2 or 4 unit models. A unit base can be upgraded with as much as you like as long as you have the space on your model.
Unless otherwise stated, an infantry unit base may have

- 1 twohanded weapon or 2 onehanded equipment (such as heavy musket, pistol&shield ...)
- Any number of independent equipment (such as grenades, gas-masks, wings...)
- A unit base may have a maximum of one unit-base weapon. (hand-held cannon)

Unless otherwise stated, the standard weapons of an infantry is a 2handed weapon


Each model of the unit base can fire it's weapons independently, and you add assault dice to the assault die pool for each unit. But all models of a unit base gets the same order, and share the same damage table.

Elites typically upgrades 1 regular model, which then replaces the regular model in the unit bases.
Weapons upgrades and aditions either replaces all weapons in all models in a unit base, replaces the weapon of a single model (typical elite), or the weapon is shared by the entire unit base not replacing the normal weapon. However normaly you then must choose between firng a unit base weapon or the normal weapon of the model. 

In some cases some equipment reqiuers an elite and the cost is typically for one weapon and only one elite in the unit base gets that weapon. However, as long as you have more elites left in the unit base, you may pay the price multiple times to equip as many as you like with elite weapons.

Unit base weapons:
Unless other wise stated, if a unit is given a unit base weapon, the unit may fire the unit base weapon a single time, OR fire its normal weapon. When firing the base weapon, apply to-hit modifiers of the best model in the unit. A unit base weapon requiers at least 2 alive models to be used. Regardless which weapon you fired, threat any weapon as unloaded after firing with either a unit-base weapon or the standar weapons of the models in the unit.

The requirements and cost of both model replacements and extra equipment should be clearly stated in the army list.

If not a unit base weapon, but the weapon requires a unit, the cost is for upgrading all models in the unit with given upgrade.
If it is a model, the cost is for upgrading ONE model. Typically requiers the model to be elite.


*Huge* units\

Any huge unit is seen from long distance. Thus, if your army includes any huge unit, you must tell your enemy about which huge unit you include before the enemy builds its own army. Thus the enemy has some time to prepare.

# Terrain 

This game is played on a hex-based map. Each hex contains a given type of terrain, some blocks line of sight and hinders movement and gives cover. For the last, see to-hit table under the fire section.

It is also possible that smoke, entrenchements etc. modify the default terrain.

For movement and line of sight, se table below:
--------              -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clear                 No modifiers
Mountains             2 movement points up, 1 down. 2 hight level, level 2 blocking terrain.
Hills                 2 movement points up, 1 down. 1 hight level, level 1 blocking terrain.
Forest                2 movement points to enter for vehicles, 1 for all other things.
                      Level 0 blocking terrain
Burned Forrest        Level 0 blocking terrain
Ruins	              1 movement points to enter. Does not block line of sight
Rough                 1 movement points to enter. Does not block line of sight
Sand Dunes            2 movement point to enter. Level 0 blocking terrain
*Advanced* *terrain*
Swamp                 1 movement point to enter for medium and smaller, 
                      +1/+2 movement points to enter for large/huge size
                      Units with track or wheel in description may get stuck,
                      at 1 or 2 on a d6, the unit cannot move this movement step, regardless of order
                      Does not block line of sight
Building              2 movement points to enter for infantry,
                      any other type cannot enter without a special rule
		      Level 0 blocking terrain.
Road                  If moving from a road to another hex with road, movement always cost 1.
Smoke                 Blocks line of sight 
                      Removed in aftermath. (place two smoke markers, remove 1 in each aftermath)
River                 +1 movement point to enter		      
Water                 1 movement point to enter for ships, floating or flying
                      (and can only be entered while flying). Cannot be entered by any other way.
--------              -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If a unit tries to enter a hex which cost more than 1 to enter, place a 'entering difficult terrain token' for the unit base. It can only move into the hex if it already have enough of these tokens to enter the hex. An hex cost 2 movement points to enter needs 1 of these token already presents, while a hex costing 3 needs 2 of those tokens. (2 token then you spend the third action to enter). You lose all tokens if you do any movement not trying to enter the hex.

Line of Sight, both hexes at ground level: trace a straight line between the center of two target hexes, if it crosses any blocking terrain (not counting the target hexes) line of sight is not obscured.

Line of sight, both hexes at 1 height level: Treat any level 0 or level 1 blocking terrain as clear hexes, but treat level 2 blocking as blocking.

Line of sight, one hex at 1 height level and one at level 0. Treat any level 1 blocking terrain as completely blocking, however any level 1 blocking terrain creates two blind hexes. Line of sight can not be traced to the blind hexes BUT can be traced beyond that.

Line of sight, one hex at 2 height level and one at level 0. Treat any level 2 blocking terrain as completely blocking, any level 1 blocking terrain as gives two blind hexes as above, but any level 0 blocking terrain creates only 1 blind hex. Line of sight can not be traced to the blind hexes BUT can be traced beyond that.


Terrain also provide cover, which is given in the to-hit table later.

*Flying* Count as being at height level 2.

*Stacking* *Limit*:\
One hex may maximum hold either up two 2 units if at most one of them is large, or 1 huge unit.
Flying units have the same stacking limits, but while flying is independent of stacking limit on ground. A flying unit may even share a hex with an enemy.

If trying to enter the same hex with MORE than that simultaneously, all from within same team/faction, then all units trying to move into the hex stay put and are *shaken* (se unit abilities and conditions) next turn.

# Building battle ground.

## Scenario: ENTRENCHED!

For a standar game: \
7x9 hexes.

The battlefield is diveded into three parts: \
NoMansLand: 2.5 and 3 middle hex rows\
Side 1: 2,5 and 3 hexes closest to side 1 of the board.\
Side 2: 2,5 and 3 hexes closest to side 2 of the board.\

NoMansLand cannot contain any blocking or advanced terrain.
Each side may design it's own terretory as you wish.

# Setup

Blind Setup:
Place a GM Screen (or something) between each side. Set up your units without know how the other side has set up. Set up simultainiusly.
Place units in the hexes 2.5 and 3 hexes from the edge of your side. Remeber to give them the appropriate speed as you see fit.

# Victory Condition

Choose which style to play:

1. Friendly match

All enemies are eliminated!


2. Turnament style: FIXED TIME

After an fixed amount of time, each player scores points according to the following:

3pt for each surviving IP 
1pt for each surviving MP, XP and CP
6pt for each destroyed enemy IP
2pt for each destroyed enemy MP,XP and CP
---
Only totally destroied units counts as destroied. An infantry unit with 1 out of 4 models standing counts as survived.
Note however that in the rare case units flee of the battlefield, they count as destroied. 

In addition, the player in the match with most points, gets 16 bonus points. If a draw, no player gets the bonus points.

Both the winner and the looser record points.
This is now called Match Victory Points (MVP).

The toruament victroy points are calculated as follows:

$$TVP = (\| MVP \| )^0.75*MVP/\| MVP \| $$

Note that both players get more points by destroying each other. Thus it is possible that a looser of one match scores more points than a winner of another match. This rewards playing aggressive.

\pagebreak

# Turn


Each turn contains the following steps:


- Gunnery 1 \
Trigger Hex effect(if hex effect was fired in a hex you were standing)\

 
- Movement 1 \
Pre assault retreat \
Trigger hex effect (including all units in contested hexes) \
Pre assault abilities

- Assault 1 \
Post assault retreat \
Trigger hex effect \
Apply damage \

- Movement 2 \
Pre assault retreat \
Trigger hex effect (including all units in contested hexes) \
Pre assault abilities\
Apply damage \

- Assault 2 \
Post Assault retreat \
Trigger hex effect \
Apply damage \

- Movement 3\
Pre assault retreat \
Trigger hex effect (including all units in contested hexes) \
Pre assault abilities \
Apply damage \

- Assault 3\
Post assault retreat \
Trigger hex effect  \
Apply damage \

- Gunnery 2\
Trigger Hex effect(if hex effect was fired in a hex you were standing) \
Apply damage \


- Agony 0 (major acid, terror)
- Agony 1 (minor acid)
- Agony 2 (fire)
- Agony 3 (poison)
- Agony 4 (bleeding)

- Aftermath  (remove smoke, etc.)

---


Multiple things may happen in same step, but they happen simultaneously. The exception is damage, where any damage taken is rolled in sequence. Roll damage in any order the attacker wishes, apply damage before rolling for next damage. But the effect of the damage in total does not apply before the apply damage step.


\pagebreak

# Orders

Give each unit base at least one movement order and the number of fire orders dictated by the unit stats. At any time you should have orders 1 round of orders ahead of time. For most units, this means you should have 1 movement order and one fire order on the table when making a new order. Then, after setting up orders, you should follow those orders.


Action are ordered in advance, and in principal everything in one step is done simultaneously. However, if the orders include choices as for example who to fire at etc. and that choice depends on what the enemy choice is, then resolve it as follows: Any unit which MAY enter an assault depending on the choices it does in movement (if existing), declares whether it want to enter an assault or not. The ones not entering assaults must choose first, and the ones entering assault second, and they must then enter assault (if possible). If there are still choices which depends on what the other chooses, the ones choosing last according to this table. The highest rank choices last:

Spartan \
Elf \
Dark-Elf \
Dwarf \
Ork \


Movement orders are dependent on whether you are fast, slow or stand-still (or possible other as special rules).

Movement orders may for example be:
(fast) F + F + -\
(fast) F + L + -\
(fast) F + B + -\
(slow) A + F + -\
(satand-still) - + - + - \

Each unit has a set of available orders. Code:


- F = forward
- R = rotate one click right
- L = rotate one click left
- B = brake, change to one speed slower.
- B[X] = as brake, but set speed to a special case, described by a X.
- A = Accelerate, change to one speed faster
- A[X] = As accelerate, but set speed to a special case, described by a X.
- Rev=reverse
- - = no action
- Chase: move towards nearest enemy.
- Follow: Are only available through special unit ordering other units to follow, and all units under these orders move one hex closer to this unit. If multiple units are odering units to follow, you can chose which to follow.
- 360$^0$: rotate in any direction you want.
- Flee: Move in any hex you like as long as you move further away from the enemy. If no such hex is available, move to a hex which is not closer to the enemy
If still no such hex is available, let your enemy move your unit to any hex he/she likes
- Road: Move along the road. Facing is always along the road.



Any order divided in 3 happens in movement step, where the first is executed in movement 1, the second in movement 2 and the third in movement 3.
If Two different letters are separated by comma instead of a +, they happen in same step. For example: \
-360$^0$,A + F + F \

Would read you could rotate 360$^0$ and accelerate in first movement, and forward in movement 2 and 3.


Gunnery orders are for example:\
- + Aim \
- + Load (stand still only) \
- + Fire\
Aim + -\
Load + -\
Fire + -\
Spot + spot \


Default Gunnery: - + - \

The first is executed in gunnery 1, the second in gunnery 2. 
Some orders are only available during one or more specific speeds/movement modes.
If a movement triggers a change in speed, it is possible that the first gunnery order (part 1) is not allowed, but part 2 is. If a unit brakes and goes from fast to slow, gunnery part 1 does not allow gunnery orders associated with slow but gunnery part 2 do.

If an illegal order is given, do the default order instead.


Load: loads weapon. A weapon cannot fire without a load token available.
      Some weapons may load more than one ammo per loading. It is then noted as load[2] or load[5] \
Aim : optional: +2 to hit. Last 1 round, and may only be used versus targets within line of sight from the original hex where the aim was issued\
Fire: fire at an enemy within line of sight and within a legal firing angle of tank. \
Spot: try to reveal a hidden unit. Roll a normal to-hit as if you where shooting. If successfull the hidden unit is revealed. \
Default: - \


The speed of the unit may restrict what options are available, which is given in paranthesis. For example \
(still) load + - +
means this unit only can load while standing still.

If, for some reason or another, the given order for one step is not allowed, it does nothing.

Important, unless otherwise stated, a unit MUST not fire at any target if it does not wish to even if you give it fire orders. This may be the case if you want to save the ammo for a better shot later.

\pagebreak

# Angles
All units are always facing one specific direction, noted as forward. Then all units has a front, front-side (Right), frond-side (left), back-side (Right), back-side(left) and and back angle.

Some values and stats depend on the angle you are using. All stats dependent on angles is divided into 4, separated by /-symbol.
The first entry is front, the second is front-side (both left and right), the third entry is back-side(both left and right) and fourth is back.

*Firing* *angles*:
\* indicates firing angle is allowed, - indicates firing with that weapon is not allowed in that angle. Anything going to the front hex-side is considered in front, and anything tracing line of sight through side-front hex-side is considered front-side etc. Shots directly inbetween front and front-side are considered on-edge of firing angle, and can be used but at a penalty (see to-hit table).

\*/-/-/-   Can fire in front only \
\*/\*/\*/\*   Can fire in any direction \


*Armor*:
Use the armor value which your target is using.
4/3/3/2   has 4 armor in front, 3 in front-side, 3 in back-side and 2 in back.

Any shot where line of sight can be traced through the front of the target is considered hitting the target in front and so forth. If a shot can be traced on the exact border between two angles, the attacker may choose where to apply the hit.

Any stat which is not divided in 4 groups is assumed to be identical for all 6 angles.

*Fixed* *Weapons*

Some models, instead of having onr raotating gun have multiple guns pointing at different dirrections. In this case, each gun is treated as only being able to fire  in the given direction, but when the weapon system is fired, all are fired simultainiously at different direction. In this case a number indicated the number of shots/weapons being able to fire in the given dirrection.

For example \
x2/x1/x1/-
indicates that the unit may fire 2 times in front, one in front-side left, once in front-side right, once in back side right and once in back side left.


ps! All units are symmetrical with respect to left and right!

\pagebreak

# Fire

At firing orders, you may roll a die to see if you hit any enemy whish you can trace line of sight to.

-If you roll a N to hit, you may roll another d6. If you roll above 4, add one to the original result. Keep rolling dice as long as you roll above 4.

Example: open ended d6: You roll a 6, then a 5 and you may roll another die. That ends up a 6 again. You roll another die and you roll a 3. The result is 6+1+1=8.


On-edge hexes: \

\pagebreak

# Damage

If you hit, roll for damage. Apply the following modifiers to Armor Penetration (AP) and damage:

                          AP,    Damage      special
------------------------ ------- ---------- ---------------------
*Range*
Long Range                -1      -1          (within max x2 of weapon range)
Normal Range              +0      +0          (within weapon range) 
Point Blank               +1      +1          (Range=1)
------------------------ -------  ---------- ---------------------



Unless the damage is of a specific type, any specified damage is regular damage, and follow these rules:

## Armor

Before you roll damage, roll armor penetration first. If unit does not have armor, skip this step, and threat shot as penetrated all armor.

How Armor penetration works is dependent on wether it is positive or negative.

If AP $\geq$ 0: \
Roll (Armor - AP) number of dice, minimum 0 \

If AP < 0:
Roll Armor number of dice.

The target number N is:

- N= 5 for weapons with  AP $\geq$ 0
- N= 4 for weapons with  AP = -1 AP 
- N= 3 for weapons with  AP = -2 AP
- N= 2 for weapons with  AP = -3 AP
- N= 1 for weapons with  AP = -4 AP



Let the shooter armor penetration be $AP$, and the target have an armor of $A$


                          Number of armor dice     Success
------------------------ ----------------------- -----------    
$AP \geq 0$                 A-AP                     5+
AP = -1                     A                        4+
AP = -2                     A                        3+
AP = -3                     A                        2+
AP = -4                     A                        1+



For

- 2 or more die above the success number N, the armor prevents all damage 
- exactly one die above the success number N, roll on damage with a -3 modifier 
- 0 die above the success number N, roll on damage normaly. 



To summerize:

                        damage modifier
----------------------- ----------------
*armor*
Blocked by armor          $-\infty$
Partly blocked by armor  -3
Penetrated armor           0 (some weapons grants you +3 here)
*previous results* 
Previous damage          +1 per token
*range*
Long range               -1
Normal range              0
Point Blank              +1
*Unit* *resistances*
XXX Resistance N         -N if damage type matches resistance.
                            (damage type is regular if unspecified)



## Damage Table:

Roll on regular damage table for the unit, add previous bonus and weapon modifiers if any. Any result less than the starting value of the damage table counts as no damage. 

Whenever one model of a unit with multiple models dies, half previous bonus to damage round down.
If a model dies from poison, remove the poison afterwards
If a model dies from bleeding, remove the bleeding.

# Special Damage types


Unless otherwise stated by the weapon, any weapon has regular damage. Some weapons and effects may have special damage in addition or instead of their normal damage. Some special damage types have special rules, which include
- Poison
- Fire

**Fire** **damage**:
Treat it as regular damage, except for resistances. Fire damage does not ignore armor, but ignore regular damage resistances, but not fire resistance.

**Poison**:
Details: see continious damage.

Other, more generic damage types will be noted by the following in weapon stats:\
- [type] damage[dN]
For example, a weapon may have Psychic Damage in addition to regular damage.

If so, and if the target has a damage table of name equal to the type of damage, roll a dN on that damage table. For example if you have
- d6 psycic damage
Roll a d6 on psychic damage table of target.
If the target don't have a psychic damage table, the unit is immune to this damage.




\pagebreak

# Assault

If two or more units from different team/faction tries to enter the same hex simultaneously, use ASSAULT rules.
Assaults also is conducted if two or more units enters each other hex. Ie they are facing each other and both moving forward.

- Before any assault, any unit which has the ability to retreat before assault have the option to do so now. 
- Then trigger any hex effects (as poison cloud, fire in hex etc.) to all units trying to enter the hex.
- Then apply any pre-assault special effects such as fear, or other abilities.
- After assault, trigger any hex effect again, but note that one unit may only be effected by the same hex effect once per turn.
This is just in case a unit was forced into a hex with for example poison cloud.

In the case where units facing each other are all moving forward, there might be two or more equally valid ways to conduct the assault. In this case, the team with the heighest melee skills determine which hex (or hexes) are being faught over:

Spartan\
Dark_Elf\
Ork\
Dwarf\
Elf\

The one gaining the advantage of the assault enters the hex it tried to enter, and disadvantage is forced out of the hex, it then retreats. If one with disadvantage was stationary, it moves out of the hex in the backward direction. If the disadvantage was trying to enter a hex, it stays in the hex it was before trying to enter the hex. 

If trying to retreat into a overcrowded hex, or an enemy, or an impassable hex, retreat to the closest possible hex. If, in the rare case you are completely surronded by  enemies, conduct another assault into the hex you normaly would have reatreated to. If you tried to enter a hex, and failed to do so, but the hex you where before is occupied by the enemy, or becomes overcrowed by your own units, treat it as retreating to an impassable hex: thus move to the closest possible hex. If you are at the edge of the battlefield, the unit gains stuborn trait. Which means that the unit is never forced to retreat from a hex it previously occupied, and it is the other unit which retreats instead. 

If more than Stacking Limit number of units enters the hex after winning an assault, all winners are also shakened as if trying to move into a hex with friendly units only. Also, note that a maxium of 2 units may contribute it's firepower.

In any way, during a retreat, the loser may rotate to Left or Right or 180$^0$ if you wish as part of the retreat. This is to make retreated unit able to flee the assault if it wants to.


Assault: Each model have the followint stats for hitting the enemy in assault:\
Number of dice, to_hit, any Damage modifiers. \
Facing : Use front assault values and armor for units entering the hex, with the exception, when reversing into an assault, set facing = back.
         For stationary units being assaulted, use assault and armor from the side which it is assaulted from.
	 If being assaulted from more than one side, choose one. This unit may only deflect hits from this side.
	 


Multiple Units: add all dice for up to stacking_limit number of unit bases, roll separate dice if necessary, both if the different units have different to_hit value for the assault and if they have different damage output.
It may be the case that some units involved have better damage, it is then necessary to track which unit did hit and which did not. If you for example have an orc-warhero with a flaming waraxe in a mix with 3 ork-grunts, roll all dice for the warhero with red dice and the grunts with blue die. If a red die hits, you may employ the flaming waraxe special damage, but if only blue dice hit, you may not.

Simillarly as for assault, some models may have assault deflection and is given in the stats of a model by
Assault Deflection: Number of dice, to_hit\
Apply front/front-side/back-side/back values as appropriate similar to the assaults.
Add the number of dice for all unit involved in the assault, roll separate dice if they have different to_hit stats.
Each succuessfull deflection remove one successful assault from the enemy. However, the one with advantage in the assault chooses which hits to deflect.

A good practice is to roll assault and assault deflections simultanieously but with different color. Choose for example green die for deflections.


Whoever rolls the highest number of successfull assaults (after deflection) gains the advantage. If equal, use Nation assault winning-power order.

Spartan\
Dark_Elf\
Ork\
Dwarf\
Elf\


It is the one who have the advantage of the assault which are preveliged to choose which enemy hits he deflects, and which of his own successes are deflected.

Now, both sides, both the disadvantage and the advantage applies assault success to the enemy. Assault successes are either damage or support. Support gives you +1 damage to the result per support given, and only damage rolls potentially causes cassualties. You start of by distributing the damaging hits, up to a maxium one damaging hit to a unit base per alive model in the unit base. Further hits are applied as support to any one ore more damage. Keep track of which hit are from which source.

Thus, if you have ONE attack which is far stronger than other attacks, it's wise to gain the advantage so that you make sure that that attack does not get deflected.

For each damage hit, apply damage similar to ranged combat. Apply assault damage, roll for assault AP versus armor, add any special effect and roll on the damage table of the unit.

Example: \
DarkElf: 1 tank, a infantry base with 4 models: 7 success, 3 deflections. \
Elf: 1 tank, a infantry base with 3 alive modles: 6 success, 3 from the tank 3 from the infantry\
Total: DarkElf 1 scored 7 hits, Elf scored 3. \
Advantage: DarkElf

Thus the DarkElf gained the advantage, and chooses to deflect the 3 attacks from the tank (they may or may not be nastier in the real game).
Thus the Elf assigns 3 hits to the darkelf and the darkelf choosed 7 hits to the elf. The elf choosed to assign 3 damaging results to the infantry.
The Darkelf choosed to assign 4 damaging success to the infantry and 1 damaging + 2 support to the tank, in hope of doing some damage.


If in the rare case that unit does not to real damage in assault, but does only psycic damage instead, and this unit is mixed with units that does real damage, threat real and psycic as seperate entries with respect to distributing hits. Thus you may roll one real damage PER enemy model in unit base in addition to one psycic damage PER enemy model in unit base. Units with real damage support attacks from real damage, while support from unit with psycic damage support attacks with psycic damage. If a model does both regular and psycic damage, support gives +1 to regular damage and +1 to psycic damage.


Examples:
Standard Tank\
   Assault:     4/ 3 / 3 /2  5+: -1 on AP, damage d6-1.\
   Deflection:  2, 5+ / -, -  / -, -  /-, - : \

This tank rolls 4 dice which hits on 5+ when assaulting a hex, and also when being assaulted from the front. Then it also gains 2 deflection die.
If this tank is stationary and is assaulted from the sides (front left, front right, back left, back right) it only gets 3 dice and no deflections.

# Unit Abilities and conditions:

**Forward Position**[N]

At setup this unit may setup upt to N hexes away from normal setup area.

**Pre-Assault** **retreat**[N+]

In pre-assault phase you may roll a die. At N+ you may retreat before the assaults starts. Treat this as a regular reatreat but give or take no assault damage. If speed is currently at stand-still it become slow afterwards. This ability may only be used if the hex retreating into neither becomes overcrowded, is an illegal hex or contain enemies.

The unit base have this ability if atleast one model in the unit has this spesicial ability.

**Stuborn**

After loosing an assualt, if you occupied the hex you where fighting over in an assault before the assault, you never retreat, and the enemy retreats instead.

**Terror**[range=n][dN]

In agony 0, roll a dN psycic damage on any enemy unit within range of this unit. Half number of dice rounded down from all enemy shaken unit bases entering assault with you. Your enemy chooses which dice to remove if they represent different attacks

**Fear**[N]

In pre-assault phase, roll a dN on psychic damage for each enemy unit base which has a psychic damage table (ignore armor and regular damage modifiers)
Half number of dice rounded down from all enemy shaken unit bases entering assault with you. Your enemy chooses which dice to remove if they represent different attacks

**Cunning** **Assault**[1 per N]

You may replace N assault successes assigned to one unit-base for light damage[d6]. 

Thus, for example Cunning Assault[1 per 2] would allow you to replace two assault-successes with one roll on light damage table (if enemy unit base has a light damage table, which typical is only for tanks and vehicles). Note that the replacements are done after asigning hits to different untis, and only hits versus targets with a light damage table can be replaced, not hits versus other units in the same assault. 

This represent any cunning way to take out heavily armored units in assaults, where regular hits would do little damage.

**Burst(N)**

This weapon can have, and must be loaded with N ammo to be fired. However, when the weapon is fired, it is fired N times (per model) at the same enemy unit base.

**Limited Ammo(N)**

This weapon may be fired a maxium of N times in a match. Many of these weapons are allways treated as load special, but it only works as long as the total number of times used is less than N.


**Set** **on** **Fire**, ranged weapons

If target is hit atleast once by a ranged weapon with this special ability, target is set on fire. See continous damage. If already on fire, apply another fire token.

**Set** *on* **Fire**, assault weapons

Any unit base hit atleast once in assault by a unit with this special is set on fire. See continous damage.

**(minor) Acid**, ranged weapons

If target is hit by a ranged weapon with this special ability, apply (minor) acid to target. See continous damage. Apply one (minor) acid per hit.

**(minor)** **Acid** [1 for N] assault weapons

Apply one minor Acid to an any enemy unit for each N successfull assault hits. If N=2 this means you may place one minor acid token for every 2nd successful assault die you do. For Minor acid, see continoius damage.



**Poison[N]**, ranged weapons

If target is hit by a ranged weapon with this special ability, apply Poison[N] to taget unit. See continous damage. Apply one Poison[n] per hit.

**Poison[M]** [1 for N], assault weapons

Apply one Poison[M] to an enemy unit base for each N successful assault hits. If N=2 this means you may place one Poison[M] token per 2nd hit. For poison, see continous damage.




[type] **Resistances**[n]

Reduce damage by [n] from damage of given type.
Default type of any shot is regular damage. Other types are always specified.

Regular: any damage rolled on regular damage table of unspecified type. This does not include damage from any other type. \
Psychic : any damage rolled on psychic damage table.\
Poison : any damage rolled by poison effect\
Fire   : any fire damage rolled 

Any other resistance may be added in future. It then is effective only versus the spesific damage type.
Damage type is either regular damage, or explisitly given by the firing unit or effect.


**Shaken**:

*Shaken*: when first shaken, place two shaken tokens. One is removed during each aftermath.
While shaken a unit carries out the default order for both movement and firing.
For vehicles this represent temporarily mechanical problems.

Replace all movement orders with the default for the given speed (given in unit description), and no orders for gunnery action. 

**Misfire[N-]**

Before using any fire action, roll a die. At N- (N or below) replace the fire action with a do nothing action. (thus this action does not spend any ammo if it misfires)

# Continuous Damage:

Applied in step: \
Agony 0 to Agony 4.

**Acid**: (roll by enemy)\ 

- At agony step 0, roll a die: \
			     at 1-: Downgrade from acid to minor acid.\
    	      	      	     at 2 : +1 to future damge
			     at 3 : as 2, and place a poison \& acid  cloud \[4, minor\](4+) at hex.\
                             at 4:  As 3, and if unit has armor, it is reduced by 1 (all directions) \
			     at 5 : As 6 and unit is set on fire.\
			     at 6 : Roll twice on this table., 

- If you happen to get two (or more) downgrade in same round, you remove acid instead of downgrading it.

**Minor** **Acid**:

- At agony step 1 roll a die, at 3+, unit base gets +1 on future damage. At 2-, remove minor acid

Unit on Fire: (roll by enemy)

- At agony step 2, roll a d6. \
At 1, the fire stops and do no damage. Remove the fire from the unit. \
Otherwise, that unit take that much fire damage, ignoring armor. But apply any fire resistance. \
If a 1 was not rolled, the unit continues burning next round.


**Poisoned**[n]\
Only biological units affected. All other types ignore poison.

- At agony step 3: Roll a dN (d4, d6, d8, d10 or d12) on damage. Apply any poison-resistance and any plus on future damage modifiers if any.
Ignore armor. Further, if poison killed one member from unit base, remove that instance of poison from unit. If not, downgrade poison by one step (12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> NONE)


**Bleeding**:

- At agony step 4: Bleeding[n]: roll a dN. If you get 1, remove the bleeding with no effect.
If not, count the result as damage, ignore armor but add bonus from previous damage as normal.
Bleeding does not cause more bleeding, but all other effects of damage are applied to unit.
If bleeding kills one member, remove this bleeding effect.


# Hex based effect.

Hex based effects are triggered in any 'trigger hex based effects' step, and only triggers the first time a unit encounters the effect in that hex this turn. It only retriggers the same turn if entering the same hex for a second time.

When placing Clouds, smoke or fire on a hex for the first time, place two markers of the given type. Otherwise, place only one.

Hex based effects are not cumulative. However the effect of acid, fire and poison on units are cumulative with both itself and each other. 


Follow the instructions for each hex based effect

**Poison** **Cloud** [N] 


Roll 1 die per biological model in hex. At 4+, apply a poison[N] to target enemy unit base. A unit base with multiple models may get multiple poison markers (standard infantry units may thus get up to 4 poison markers)

In addtion, roll a die for any unit with a crew damage table. At 4+ do dN crew damage to unit.

**Acid** **Cloud** [Minor] 

Roll a die per unit base in hex. At 4+ place a minor acid on the unit base.


**Acid** **Cloud** [Major] 

Roll a die per unit base in hex. At 4+ place a regular acid on the unit base.



**Poison** & **Acid** **Cloud** [N, minor/major] = poison Cloud[N] + acid Cloud [minor/major]



**Hex** **on** **Fire**\
When setting a hex on fire, place a smoke and fire token in the hex.
When encountering a fire, Roll 1 die per unit base, at 5+ set that unit base on fire.







**AFTERMATH**: \
Remove one Cloud or smoke in each hex

Remove one fire token in a hex and replace any forest in such a hex with rough terrain.

Remove one shaken token from each unit base.
