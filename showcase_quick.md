Unit abilities

**Take Cover**[speed, -N]

When unit is in given speed the unit is considered taking cover and gets -N to be hit, as indicated by to-hit table. Whenever this condition apply, AND unit is in cover-providing terrain, also gain the Evasion[-1] trait.

**Forward Position**[N]

At setup this unit may setup up to N hexes away from normal setup area.


**Terror**[range=n][dN]

In agony 0, roll a dN psychic damage on any enemy unit within range of this unit. Any Shaken enemy units engaging a unit with Terror in assault rolls only half the number of dice (rounded down) for the assault (assault deflection is not affected). Your enemy chooses which dice to remove if they represent different attacks.

**Cunning** **Assault**[1 per N]


May be used instead of regular assault damage against a vehicle. For each N assault successes assigned to one vehicle (model with type vehicle) in assault (assault damage and supporting hits), add +1 to all future damage token to that whith the vehicle type. If you manage to inflict two or more +1 to future damage this way, the enemy is shaken.

Thus, for example if you hit the an enemy with a unit which have Cunning Assault[1 per 2] 4 times, you will add two +1 to future damage tokens and the enemy is shaken. 


This represent any cunning way to take out heavily armored units in assaults, where regular hits would do little damage.
